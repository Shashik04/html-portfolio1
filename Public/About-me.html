    <p>Hello! I'm Shashikant Yadav, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<br> I am passionate about web development and eager to build a career in this dynamic field. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in web technologies, programming languages, and software development principles.<br>

        I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have experience working with frameworks such as React and Angular. My hands-on projects have honed my skills in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications. I am also familiar with backend technologies like Node.js and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.
